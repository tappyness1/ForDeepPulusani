Hi Deep,

My account at Upwork has been suspended for reasons which don't make sense to me. It is quite common among honest freelancers apparently. Damage is done, I'll be moving on from there. What choice do I have right?
Thanks for taking the time to interview me. If you liked my work, I will be happy to work with you more deeply on this work on other platforms or even just directly with you. 

Thanks again.

Calvin.
